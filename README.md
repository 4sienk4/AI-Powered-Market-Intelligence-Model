# AI-Powered Market Intelligence Engine (Churn Prediction)

An automated n8n pipeline designed to quantify player churn risks by analyzing the gap between monetization and progression friction.

## Overview
This system transforms raw community data into structured business intelligence. It was built to identify why players drop out of live-service economies, using a dataset of N=950 records from the Fortnite ecosystem as a primary case study.

## Architecture & Logic
The workflow is built modularly to ensure scalability and easier debugging:

* **Ingestion Layer**: Automated scraping from Reddit (r/FortNiteBR) with integrated rate-limiting to handle API constraints.
* **Analysis Loop**: Batch-processed sentiment analysis using Gemini 2.5 Flash. It classifies feedback into three core buckets: Price, Time, and General Engagement.
* **Reporting Branch**: An autonomous logic that calculates global statistics and generates a strategic summary without human intervention.

## Tech Stack
* **Orchestration**: n8n (Modular Workflow)
* **LLM**: Google Gemini API
* **Data Modeling**: Airtable (Relational Database)
* **Logic**: JavaScript (Custom JSON parsing & sanitization)

## Security & Implementation
* **Credential Handling**: The provided `workflow.json` contains credential IDs only. To run this, you must link your own Gemini and Airtable API keys within your n8n instance.
* **Error Handling**: Implemented Wait/Buffer nodes to manage API rate limits and Code nodes for robust data parsing.

## Key Insights
The model successfully identified that **"progression friction"** (Avg. Frustration: 5.3/10) is a more frequent churn driver than direct financial cost in the current meta. This led to a strategic recommendation for **"Legacy Battle Pass"** models to improve long-term player retention.
